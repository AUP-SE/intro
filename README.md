# Welcome to the Software Engineering course!

Welcome to the introduction page for the Software Engineering course
given in fall 2016 in the American University of Paris.

The syllabus can be found at https://github.com/AUP-SE/syllabus.

On this page you will find information of how to get your development environment up and ready.

## Setting Up the Development Environment

One of the required skills of a software engineer is the ability to
work in teams and to manage revisions of his work.

We will use the [git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_%28software%29)
version control system and the [github](https://github.com/) hosting
service as the primary media of exchange between the participants of the
class.

To start, please open an account on [github](https://github.com/).
Once the account has been opened and verified, please send an email
to tlibal@aup.edu with your username.

A software engineer should be able to easily set up and use any
technology which might help improve the development process.
In addition, he should be able to customize the environment to his needs in order to
speed up development. As long as the software does not depend on the [.NET Framework](https://www.microsoft.com/net),
a recommended operating system for software development is one of the
[linux](https://www.kernel.org/) distributions.

In this course we will use the popular [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/)
distribution. Since our Lab computers are running Windows, we will use
the cloud service [Cloud9 IDE](http://c9.io/) as our development
environment.

Please open a free account (TODO)
and create a new workspace.
Make sure to choose Blank for a template.
From now on, you will always use this workshop for solving exercises and
working on your project.

Your development environment is divided into the "Navigator" on the
left, the "Editor" on the top and the "Terminal" at the bottom of the
screen. In order to open and edit a file, you need to double click it.

The Terminal is a command-line took which allows you to issue commands
to the operating system. It will be our main tool for development.

You are now ready to go to the next step. In the Terminal please execute
the following commands. You will need to use your new github username
and password.
```
git clone https://github.com/AUP-SE/ex1
cd ex1
ls
```

Now, left click the file README.md and choose open. The file should open
in the Editor space. Please follow the instructions in the file.
